Day 13 Subnetting PART 1 

The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) introduced **CIDR** in 1993 to replace the "Classful" addressing system.

With CIDR the classful requirments of: Class A = /24, Class B = /16, Class C = /24 were removed. 

CIDR allows for larger networks to be split into smaller networks, allowing for greater efficiency. CIDR allows us to assign different prefix lengths EX: /21 instead of /24 for a Class C.

These smaller networks are called "subnetworks" or "subnets".

How to calculate how many usable host address in a network 

2^N - 2 = usable addresses

N = number of host bits 
-2 = For the Network address and the Broadcast address
